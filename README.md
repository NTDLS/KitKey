# KitKey

Ever wondered what it would be like if Redis hadn't become a fat beast?
Well, we wanted to keep it simple and really target the .net environment so we wrote KitKey!

A low latency, high-performance, and reliable persistent or ephemeral key-value store over TCP/IP.

KitKey utilizes RocksDB for persistence, wrapped in a partitioned memory cache for level-1 caching.
